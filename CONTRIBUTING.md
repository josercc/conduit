# Contributing
- For bug fixes, please file an issue or submit a pull request to master. 
- For documentation improvements (typos, errors, etc.), please submit a pull request to the branch `docs/source`.
- For new features that are not already identified in issues, please file a new issue to discuss.

## Pull Request Requirements

Please document the intent of the pull request. All non-documentation pull requests must also include automated tests that cover the new code, including failure cases. If applicable, please update the documentation in the `docs/source` branch.

## Running Tests

Tests will automatically be run when you submit a pull request (PR), but you will need to run tests locally before submitting your PR.

The Conduit repo contains scripts to make running the unit tests easier.

The scripts a written using dcli so you need to install dcli first:

```bash
pub global activate dcli
```


To configure unit tests, including install a docker based postgres image run:

```bash
tool/setup_unit_tests.dart

```

To run the unit tests:

```
tool/run_unit_tests.dart
```

These scripts install a docker container running postgres on an alternate port 15432 and then
run the unit test against those scripts.

### Manual db configuration
If you have to create your own postgres install (not recommended) then you need to configure
it to run on port 15432.

Environment variables:

POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PORT
POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DB
POSTGRES_PORT


tool/.setting.yaml

```yaml
# SettingsYaml settings file
POSTGRES_HOST: localhost
POSTGRES_PORT: 15432
POSTGRES_USER: conduit_test_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: conduit!
POSTGRES_DB: conduit_test_db
```



If you have installed postgres yourself then you will need to create the test db:

```bash
psql -c 'create user conduit_test_user with createdb;' -U postgres
psql -c "alter user conduit_test_user with password 'conduit!';" -U postgres
psql -c 'create database conduit_test_db;' -U postgres
psql -c 'grant all on database conduit_test_db to conduit_test_user;' -U postgres
```

# Running unit tests manually

Before you can manually run the unit tests you MUST have configured your postgres db as described above.


Run all tests with the following command:

```
pub run test -j 1
```


# Running individual unit tests

If you need to run an individual unit tests that requires the test postgres db, can use:

```
tool/start_db.dart
```

You need to have either run tool/setup_unit_tests.dart to correctly configure the db settings.
